As the Head Master mentioned in Speech Room this morning the week ahead is the second National Green Careers Week and there are several noteworthy events happening for you to be aware of. As part of the PSHE programme tomorrow all boys in the Sixth Form will have a presentation by Mr Mark Haviland, one of the leading figures in the field in the UK, on the subject of �Conscious Careers.�  There are also several other workshops and talks happening around the Hill and I write to tell you of two such opportunities.  The Age of the Purposeful Entrepreneur on Tuesday with Mark Haviland at 1 PM (two places still available, first come first served) The Green Engineer on Friday (request a place by replying to this email asap)    DMM also has organised a superb talk on Thursday 9th November 6.30 � 7.30 pm by Prof. Alison Anderson will provide a talk with a Q&A session on how �Communication is Key to Fighting the Climate Crisis.�wow..so yh, careersits so coldwhat the email or temperaturelike my arm was hurting from holding my book up-and my legs hurt :(and my nose is cold.:(i should give u acuddle and warm u upmhmwrap up warmhav u got a hot water bottlemhmohh btw did u get my cs society email?ur cs email?hold onyh i didoh also!i mentioned the hackathon u mentioned in comp ski and basically...idk what mr porter thinks but they want a little bit more detailthat's fineit's all very general rnthe gist is that for the past like 5 years our CS society has run a hackathon with Harrow International Schoolsok well lmk when yk more :)and vincent is keen to get other schools involved too and rebrand the hackathonmhmwe'll probs send porter a formal email or sththats probably a good ideai think i got his email add somewhere or otherotherwise i'm thinking of asking around at eton seeing if anyone keenok well u dont send itget crowe tolikewise winchesteryeah yeah cool i'll get crowe tohmm maybe i can get matt to give me contact at MT who can organisse?vinny knows a guy from american school ldn so they might be interestedi think they wanna get DBS hong kong interested too ? is it like a create sth hackathonnah its a problem solving stylewackathon styleohmakes sensebut also booorinhholdon lemme find the q's from last yr as a sampleomg do u hv like a proper online platformHarrow Football is an ancient version of soccer played at Harrow School in London. There are twelve teams (one for each boarding house) that play on Sundays.Soccer goals are called bases in Harrow Football.In this question, we�ll be tracking one of the teams in a match, the oldest boarding house -Druries.During a hypothetical season,�Druries scores 1 base in their first match.�Druries scores 2 bases in their second match.�Druries scores 3 bases in their third match.�Druries scores 5 bases in their fourth match.�Druries scores 8 bases in their fifth match.In their Nth match,�Druries scores (the sum of the bases scored in its previous two matches) bases.Calculate how many bases (goals) Druries scores in total over the whole 10 match season.Hint: The bases scored follow the Fibonacci sequence.nah its a word doc from last yearalthough i did code an online platform so am keen to fix it and get it running this year^ i wrote that question :DThat's "yellow grade" so medium basicallyh looks like a question you would writeim a bit annoyed at the 'soccer' thoughyeah well it's pitched to an international audienceits football.Harrow International NYC gotta understand ykits. still. football.anyway here's a red Q:All the Harrow Head Masters meet online to plan the 450th celebratory event. The Head Master of Harrow Hong Kong is a rather superstitious individual, and is very nervous that the 450th anniversary event will fall on Friday 13th, traditionally a very unlucky day. She asks the Computer Science Department to produce a program that can check if a given month and year contains a Friday 13th. Write a function that takes any month and year as integers, and returns whether that month contains a Friday 13th as a True or False output. January should be input as 1, February as 2 and so on. Run your program for the remaining months of 2022, and take a screenshot of the outputs to add to your answer booklet e.g.(4,2022)(5,2022) (6,2022) (7,2022) etc. Hint: Python's datetime module may be helpful to check weekdays.thats not too bad..i mean i say thatthey forgot to credit me as a question writer on the document ;(haits cuz of the socceran act of blasphemy.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MRnLvAA37xAYR2yIHPzYocIJjPKQP28OGLePGo37G_I/edit?usp=sharinghav a loook :Dgosh david be carryingi might have a little go at them later :)ya wont meet david probablyhe's an undergrad engineer at oxford now2nd yearthat makes sense-i think i should put the textss in speech bubblesand auto-scrollno you should make it like a command lineugh whatsapp has spoiilt meblack and green hacker styleuh noewthats so dodgewow there's so much random old stuff on my google docshttps://docs.google.com/document/d/12_Wvn_1_i9MHHEc6QqBySpamevqZS17HR-xT7-83VNA/edit?usp=sharingi mean actually tho...if i ever wanna talk to u in class...having a html page with 'talk to me' in big blue letters is probs not very subtle...OMGI LOVE SUDOKUlmao yeah not subtlei went thru a whole phase cuz someone kept telling me i had dementia-uhm okaypk ur not matching my energy hereuhmlets seemiss u <3https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QAfcTAlsxNHf639d1tCjVP0MokGE1KiW/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101083009086126104633&rtpof=true&sd=true'The river Misbourne is a river that starts in Mobwell, a small dwelling outside of Great Missenden (North of High Wycombe).'good to know-so don't step in the river okuh surewasn;t plannign topmg there's a pic of me in wellies in that dochidden on the side loldid u do a geo fieldwork project?acc did u do common enterance?uh i did 11+ common entrance...13+ ?no cuz i got in-oh yeh ofcsillydyl~yh?its very cold...and im a little bit sleepy...okay...can i send u one more memethen u can sleeeep.uh surehttps://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1kqGoaQ0_Y0Cxw3zMUaL3UvmVuGLpPy8hg8928_LBIfg/edit?usp=sharingha. ha. ha.so funnyhehei want a cuddle :(u can rest now wrap up warmmmu can have a cuddlein a few daysi miss u sooo muchi miss u toogoodnight then~i luv u<3gnheelooooback from climbinghellohiwho is me?(i mean on the chat, i'm not having an existential crisis)(at least, rn)me is ur mumjust meermhi mumhow was climbingfine igvincent wasnt cause apparently he's doing an interview for something or otherso i paired with jayden todayanywaysu r in a lesson now?yesomg i also hv a mock interviewin an hourlove you xxluv u too oxoxohope the mock goes well :)thank uuuhows lifeaok herehow is your lifestressfuki rlly hope the eton dude is nicei can't have my confidence shattered for tmr-ig i'll just take it as like very interrogative maths tutoringjust do the best that you can :)i'm sure you'll do greati hope soits okits maths-all maths has an answer right?unless its quantum mechanics...umwell 1) not all maths has an answerand 2) even if it does, you don't have to get the answerit'd be nice if u did thoit would be nicemeowmeow!meow.meowwwgonna go dt now cya l8r.just finished mock interview...he said my maths and curve sketching is good...i just need to know more about algorithms :/like actual compski stuff-why am i null-helloooohiiii built an sr flip flop in minecraft and irlirl...?irllemme send u vid holdonuploading...how r uim goodnervous about tmr tho...how r u feeling for tmrhow r ui'm okay.missing umiss u toowhadya get up to other than interview prepinterview prepi had my primary school placement todayits so heartwarming when the kids get excited when they see uawww did they remember u from last wkmhm :)buti was reading with one of the girlsand the story ended with the character talking about her stuffed toysand then i asked her what her favourite toy washttps://gofile.io/d/wChRXGmhm?and then she said told me that her baby brother passed away and she kept one of his toys and it was really special and i could see the pain in her eyes so i quickly tried to change the subjectthats so sadit was so heartwrenching-i almost cried-i would've burstwhy was i expecting an actual flip flop for a second-like ones u wear on feet?lolwell yh..but circuit is cool toomhmnerdHEYno u heheno udefo u(maybe me too)erm no youare such a nerdlike you are the dictionary definitioneven convoluted neural networks would conclude thatlmaooooyk what the definition is on urban dictionary?Nerd: "One whose IQ exceeds his weight"loseroh lmaothat too iglol yk what geek is ?hey no fair u hv lower threshold hmphwhats geek then"The people you pick on in high school and wind up working for as an adult -

more than capable of doing thatIkIt's just Idk if I'm approaching my life the right way rnI tell myself (and others) that the way to live life is maximise happiness And rn I'm not happywell thats life for uI'm stressed and overworked, and I chose thisur not always gonna be happybecause you have to earn itsadly in this world, hapiness doesn't grow from treessometimes u have to put in a little bit of effort and work, to gurantee a long term of hapinessbut even then'long term happiness 'what if things don't work out?and if they do, what if they were gonna work out anyways that doesn't matterbecause you don't know that and you never willwould my life be that much different in 20 years if I took Economics a-lvl instead of DT or didn't take CS a lvlwhat matters is that you increase ur chancesI don't think it wouldMaybe that's naive of meyour life would be different rnYeah, I'd probably be happy rn there are so many intricacies in lifeyou dont know how ud be feelingand that doesn't matterI

need to remember to do itOkayu can just be there when i try and struggle to use this IFFF thingIFTTToh rightthatif this then thatohIFtttthat makes senseIndeedin my head i took button thing quite literallyin the sense that i wrote a little bit of code for led on piheh-huh?explain?no like literallyu just flash the led from a websiteum so whatu can push the buttonnoits pretty useless when i realisedand it flashes my led??yh but then it doesn't do thatI'm confusedyh its finebe confusedOkayDon't be confused be confused.com.but alsoif u wanted tocould u just code it on the website u sent me?on ifttt?yh that thingso you're sayingcan I put the buttons on ifttas like html buttonsuhmigwell, uhm, no actuallyohIt's to do with how webhhooks workwhats a webhookbasically i could code another

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.     The bee, of course, flies anyway     because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.     Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I'm excited.     Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B's.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I'd make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That's why we don't need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it's just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     "What's the difference?" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.     Their day's not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We're going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you're interested in?     - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.     You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!     Let's open some honey and celebrate!     Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.     Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!     I'm so proud.     - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.     Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.     Yeah, right.     Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...     - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!     One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.     - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!     Wow!     Oouple of newbies?     Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!     Make your choice.     - You want to go first? - No, you go.     Oh, my. What's available?     Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.     - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.     I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.     Wax monkey's always open.     The Krelman opened up again.     What happened?     A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.     Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!     Oh, this is so hard!     Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,     humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,     mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?     Barry!     All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...     What happened to you? Where are you?     - I'm going out. - Out? Out where?     - Out there. - Oh, no!     I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.     You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?     Another call coming in.     If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd     that gets their roses today.     Hey, guys.     - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?     Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.     It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.     Really? Feeling lucky, are you?     Sign here, here. Just initial that.     - Thank you. - OK.     You got a rain advisory today,     and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.     So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,     hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.     Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.     Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!     - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies,     bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!     All right, launch positions!     Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!     Black and yellow!     Hello!     You ready for this, hot shot?     Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.     Wind, check.     - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.     - Wings, check. - Stinger, check.     Scared out of my shorts, check.     OK, ladies,     let's move it out!     Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!     All of you, drain those flowers!     Wow! I'm out!     I can't believe I'm out!     So blue.     I feel so fast and free!     Box kite!     Wow!     Flowers!     This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.     Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.     Roses!     30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.     Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.     That is one nectar collector!     - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.     I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there,     a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.     That's amazing. Why do we do that?     That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.     Oool.     I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?     Oopy that visual.     Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.     Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?     Affirmative.     That was on the line!     This is the coolest. What is it?     I don't know, but I'm loving this color.     It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.     Yeah, fuzzy.     Ohemical-y.     Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.     My sweet lord of bees!     Oandy-brain, get off there!     Problem!     - Guys! - This could be bad.     Affirmative.     Very close.     Gonna hurt.     Mama's little boy.     You are way out of position, rookie!     Ooming in at you like a missile!     Help me!     I don't think these are flowers.     - Should we tell him? - I think he knows.     What is this?!     Match point!     You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!     Yowser!     Gross.     There's a bee in the car!     - Do something! - I'm driving!     - Hi, bee. - He's back here!     He's going to sting me!     Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!     He blinked!     Spray him, Granny!     What are you doing?!     Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.     I gotta get home.     Oan't fly in rain.     Oan't fly in rain.     Oan't fly in rain.     Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!     Ken, could you close the window please?     Ken, could you close the window please?     Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.     You see? Folds out.     Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.     What was that?     Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...     Drapes!     That is diabolical.     It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.     What's number one? Star Wars?     Nah, I don't go for that...     ...kind of stuff.     No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.     When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.     There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.     I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.     I predicted global warming.     I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.     Wait! Stop! Bee!     Stand back. These are winter boots.     Wait!     Don't kill him!     You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!     Why does his life have less value than yours?     Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?     I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.     My brochure!     There you go, little guy.     I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.     Put that on your resume brochure.     My whole face could puff up.     Make it one of your special skills.     Knocking someone out is also a special skill.     Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.     - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.     - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye.     - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye.     I gotta say something.     She saved my life. I gotta say something.     All right, here it goes.     Nah.     What would I say?     I could really get in trouble.     It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.     I can't believe I'm doing this.     I've got to.     Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!     No. Yes. No.     Do it. I can't.     How should I start it? "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.     Here she comes! Speak, you fool!     Hi!     I'm sorry.     - You're talking. - Yes, I know.     You're talking!     I'm so sorry.     No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming.     But I don't recall going to bed.     Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.     This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!     I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this,     but they were all trying to kill me.     And if it wasn't for you...     I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.     That was a little weird.     - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah.     I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!     I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now.     - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?     The talking thing.     Same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.     - That's very funny. - Yeah.     Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.     Anyway...     Oan I...     ...get you something? - Like what?     I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee?     I don't want to put you out.     It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.     - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose.     - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.     Hey, you want rum cake?     - I shouldn't. - Have some.     - No, I can't. - Oome on!     I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.     - Where? - These stripes don't help.     You look great!     I don't know if you know anything about fashion.     Are you all right?     No.     He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.     He finally gets there.     He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.     And he says, "Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.     Why would I marry a watermelon?"     Is that a bee joke?     That's the kind of stuff we do.     Yeah, different.     So, what are you gonna do, Barry?     About work? I don't know.     I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.     I know how you feel.     - You do? - Sure.     My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.     - Really? - My only interest is flowers.     Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.     Anyway, if you look...     There's my hive right there. See it?     You're in Sheep Meadow!     Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!     No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.     - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not?     - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that.     - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.     Just having two cups of coffee!     Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.     Yeah, it's no trouble.     Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.     Are you...?     Oan I take a piece of this with me?     Sure! Here, have a crumb.     - Thanks! - Yeah.     All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around.     Or not.     OK, Barry.     And thank you so much again... for before.     Oh, that? That was nothing.     Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...     This can't possibly work.     He's all set to go. We may as well try it.     OK, Dave, pull the chute.     - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing!     It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.     Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!     Giant, scary humans! What were they like?     Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.     They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.     - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't.     - How'd you get back? - Poodle.     You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.     You had your "experience." Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.     - Well... - Well?     Well, I met someone.     You did? Was she Bee-ish?     - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.     - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.     I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.     I can't get by that face.     So who is she?     She's... human.     No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.     - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy.     She's so nice. And she's a florist!     Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!     We're not dating.     You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes     with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!     She saved my life! And she understands me.     This is over!     Eat this.     This is not over! What was that?     - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey!     And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat!     - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No.     It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...     Sit down!     ...really hot! - Listen to me!     We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!     Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?     There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     There he is. He's in the pool.     You know what your problem is, Barry?     I gotta start thinking bee?     How much longer will this go on?     It's been three days! Why aren't you working?     I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.     What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!     Would it kill you to make a little honey?     Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.     Martin, would you talk to him?     Barry, I'm talking to you!     You coming?     Got everything?     All set!     Go ahead. I'll catch up.     Don't be too long.     Watch this!     Vanessa!     - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him.     He doesn't respond to yelling!     - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen!     I'm not listening to this.     Sorry, I've gotta go.     - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend.     A girl? Is this why you can't decide?     Bye.     I just hope she's Bee-ish.     They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?     To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!     Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.     A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?     No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?     It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.     Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.     TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!     You don't have that?     We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.     Oh, my.     Dumb bees!     You must want to sting all those jerks.     We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.     So you have to watch your temper.     Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,     write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:     Anger, jealousy, lust.     Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?     Yeah.     - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.     He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!     What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?     Yeah, it was. How did you know?     It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.     You've really got that down to a science.     - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet.     What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?     How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,     Ray Liotta Private Select?     - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him.     - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it.     You don't have enough food of your own?     - Well, yes. - How do you get it?     - Bees make it. - I know who makes it!     And it's hard to make it!     There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!     - It's organic. - It's our-ganic!     It's just honey, Barry.     Just what?!     Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!     You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have!     And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.     I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!     Hey, Hector.     - You almost done? - Almost.     He is here. I sense it.     Well, I guess I'll go home now     and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.     You're busted, box boy!     I knew I heard something. So you can talk!     I can talk. And now you'll start talking!     Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?     I don't understand. I thought we were friends.     The last thing we want to do is upset bees!     You're too late! It's ours now!     You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!     You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!     Where is the honey coming from?     Tell me where!     Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!     Orazy person!     What horrible thing has happened here?     These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now     they're on the road to nowhere!     Just keep still.     What? You're not dead?     Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?     To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.     I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!     I'm going to Tacoma.     - And you? - He really is dead.     All right.     Uh-oh!     - What is that?! - Oh, no!     - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?     Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!     Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!     How much do you people need to see?!     Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!     From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell.     But don't kill no more bugs!     - Bee! - Moose blood guy!!     - You hear something? - Like what?     Like tiny screaming.     Turn off the radio.     Whassup, bee boy?     Hey, Blood.     Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.     Wow!

Instead, most people would think of the trends and the traditions associated with christmas such as gift-giving and acts of kindness. The reason christmas has become so globalised is because of its moral contributions to society. Moreover, the commercialisation of christmas is another factor in which it has further steered from a religious holiday. tbc:)actuallyi think if i continueu will get boredumMaybebut basicallybut u canin a nutsehllcontinueits exactly what u saidchristmas is a capitalist paradisechristmas = money = people having a reason to be happy+charitable organisations and encouraging good social and communal actsmoneyyyyyyokokthis is why u dont ask memy opinion on a motioni wont bore u any longer :)I enjoyed hearing your thoughts on it :).u did?yeahOfchuhinterestingusually when i start debatingpeople just abstain immediately heh-abstain?they just withdraw...likedisappear?give up?uh yh kindathat's sadmhmbut im happythat u enjoyed reading my opinionyou are?that's nice:)I'm in bed now yayywhoseyoursgo upstairs jkim next to my bedsilllyaw mancaught lyinghehedisappointingbut i think u'd prefer if i was in ur bedmy bed is smolRafferty is coming to annoy everyone .oh okhe's gonethat was quickmy bed is smol tooyeah I told him to piss offykjk*ohohur bed is smolmy bed is smolbut mine is smol erplus its a bunk bedI have a single at school and a single at homewith a top bunk inhabitant:(ive seen ur bed :)i can squeeze not irl...

someone would play with him and his vrVR ?and i asked him if he would excite ppl like the ghost didyh vrlikevirtual reality?he said he already did that...how old is this kid..?year 5so 10..?i think?right...he was so preciousinteresting that a kid so young is on vrur just oldholonhe was so smileyand so innocent...like i almost cried im not jokingim sure ive told u this beforebut one of the things i hate the most in this worldis kids being neglected or hurtmaybe even the worst thinglike it makes me sick:(alsoboth of us got takenby some other visitor?mhm?i thought at first a counsilor wait how do u spell thatcouncellor?anywayshe made us play this gameand then i thought maybe it could've been like a learning enhancement or sth of the sort?but then his reading aptitude was pretty average in comparison to his classso i was a bit confused...anyway i played the gameand with my last readerwhat was the game?it was liketummyache?anywayshe was reading a book about this girl who had a vision imparimentwhomade friends with someone who got neglected by her ex best friendand convinced her that ppl arent weirdthey r just differentand at the end i asked herif there was someone different in her class, would she make friends with themand then maybe i shouldn't have done this...but...i asked her if she found anyone in her class being left out and if she would make friends with themand she said yhand then i asked her to do that for me...as a favour....i didnt mention the kids name:obut maybe that was a bit out of line of me...nono it's goodnice ideai just felt really overwhelemedi really wanted to do somethingbeing neglected...at that age...really sucksmonsters can cultivate inside of the smiliest, most innocent and caring children...:(nobody should have to shut up and become

emotional control idkBut a) would u ask someone to do that for u?(there r multiple parts to this q)Also im gonna pee while u answerum okayWell first I need to understand what you mean by "thing" and "pie hole"My interpretation is that you're referring to oral sex..?informally : "head", "BJ", etcYespkayso you're askingYes thats what im askingDw no need to type itholy shit tfl charged me �16 in tube fairsRipwell uhSo you're askingJust answerDont repeat the qwhy not?I need to understand the qUgh fine whatever ContinueI.ewould I ask for oral sex?Yhanswer probably yesbut i would t force on

power dynamic And people feed into thatofcit's their only exposure to how it should work right?Yhnobody asks their parents for sex advice IgI thjnkif someone breaks up with another person because they didn't give them sexthen that wasn't really a relationship it was just manipulation mahbe I'm extremeNo i agreeIn some sensein what sense do you disagree?Well uhh ig it may not entirely be manipulation Cuz ig there is an element of expectation right...Eeeek my backOk I'm backNo pun intendedsoif a partner told youthey couldn't have sex for some reason Doesn't mattrrwould that theoretically ruin the expectation?Well personally noBc my idea of a relationship doesn't involve sexright...doesn't involve full stop..?I thinkNot full stopI just wanna go that intimate before proper

I see.I need a hugHave a virtual onethere's just beena lot of tensionbetween my parents, latelyOh..because they're both busy with their own shitand both stressed and tired and drainedHmm can they take a breakbreak from what?Work...?well yeahover Christmas that's the planOh goodie so not too farbut they gotta hold out till thrnI'm sure they will with tbe right motivation and energythis weekend was not supposed to be as stressful as it was...What happened...my dad had a really stressful day at our religios place thingy yesterday for the part year and a bit he's been planning to move everyone to a new computer network where all users have new PCs with win 11a few people in planning have been really meanTelling him his migration failedOh :(and was a waste of timejust becausethey r lazy and liked it the old way betterwhich was worse and less secureWell they can go eat a stinging netleNettle it requires effort to change if u see what I meananyways so that was roughAnd thenYhyh but always prioritise securitymy mum did most of the housework all day yesterday by herselfwhich is exhausting Because it's a week's worth of domestic crammed into a day:(You didnt help her?!I was with my dad...During the week...?during the week?YhSpread it out...?well maybe I should've got some of the stuff donebut she always says howwhen she was growing upher younger brother's never did the houseworkit was their responsibility to studyand get a better jovwhile the women of the household did the choresthat kinda is engrained in herYh i mean its only coincidental the girls are the older ones hereshe doesn't ask us for helpTbhanyways then today soBut im sure u know what needs to be donewe went to the post office to get a IDP for my mum so she can drive in americaand afterwards, we knew we'd have to pick up a parcel from my grandma's sister in law right?sowe drove to Tesco to get her a box of chocolates first/ get some Xmas shopping done anyways After my dad finally finds parkingthe mosque closes or sth? And the market too?and then the streets get flooded with carsand the car park gets jammed really baddso we finish our shopping and meet dad in the cargive him a snackand then decide that there's too much traffic in the car parkso me and mum would take the bus to Southall to pick up the packages anyways so thenmy dad takes almost two hours to get home from the car park he thought he'd have a relaxing subdaytbut spent an insane amount of time driving out the car parkso it really really stressed him outthen so me and mum get the packages after the bus journeyand she gets her eyebrows done tooand thenthe packages are heavy afso we walk to my aunt's houseWhere we drop them and have some lunchand then we walked to the station and met Ryan on a train and went into ldn it actually took multiple attempts to get Ryan on the train at our local home station since his card didn't have enough money in itso again, stressed out my dad more afterwards he meets us in the train and we go meet Jessica in ldngo winter wonderlandand thenlatest he is Ryan btwso then we head home afterAnd walk back from station and thenmy mum makes me and Ryan some jacket potatoes for a dinner ishand then I wrap presents for like an hour while Ryan tries to fix the coffee machineand then I finally finish up and get ready for bedand I head downstairs and mum+dad are arguingso I walk in and wellit's so tenseya still there?Mhmwell yeah It was so tebsetenseand he made some scary threatsOhLater i went to hug him and kinda told me noI justThink that everyone needs a break to chill the fuck outI think u r rightBut dont take what he said or did to heartI'm a lil scaredOftentimes in the heat of the monentI've never seen them like this bad beforeMomentPpl say and do things they dont mean toI hope you are rightAnd some people let it out slowlyAnd some just burst bc we all have our own ways of dealing with thingsyeahBut an argument out of the blue with no building tensionIs usually okoh but there's been lots of building tensionOh?yeah.likedidn't ya hear my story?That was just todayoh wellthere's been other stuffsThat's been going on since me and Ryan got homePossibly earlier too and we didn't know my dad's been trying to plan my mum's 50th birthday partybutshe's changed her mind a few timesand he's had to accommodate those changes every timeOhThat makes a bit more sense thoThenand he knows that he can't get her what she sees in her headlikeThat's probably why he's upsetshe wanted a big party in a hall with a DJ and food for all her friend and sfuffsbut likehe can't do itit'll cost like 10Kwe can't afford that rnand likealso things likeher car is brokenand he hasn't found time to look into getting it looked at since he's been so busy with work and religious thingies hm what elsethe back door has been broken since my birthday?no, sincr Halloween basically You can't open the back doorfull stopalso, till Friday the heating was broken Right...i think I know what ur getting at hereand one radiator is still brokenor things likehe I leaves like his jeans and stuff around the house all the timebut that's usually because when he crashes after work and things he'll just put his stuff anywhereand that winds my mum upStuff's broken, parents burnt out and mum want big party?wellalso our trip to vegaslot of tension thereRight...that we managed to resolve but stillmy cousin Nikita basically invited herselfHuh?and my dad thought it was my mum's fault for telling her about the tripin such a wayOhh I seeThat my mum convinced her she could comeapparently nowNikita is someone I trust a lotshe really looks out for me and ryanand cares about us but she's quite crazy sometimesshe'll do risky shitor she'll get into arguments with peopleI see...I thinkso obviouslywe didn't want her to comeso in the endYour parents are too niceit was really difficult for my parents to say no to gerher*because they knew they couldn't take herAnd think they can deal with problems by themselvesbut didn't wanna feel guiltyBecause they are both very independent and responsibleyeah I guess..Which is why they're stuck nowthere was a point where my dad nearly called off the trip entirelyBecause the only way they can solve their issuesIs by flatout straightforward communication because he reached a point where he'd rather not piss Nikita off and the rest of our extended familyand that really made my mum sadBecause it was supposed to be a trip for herand he chose the extended family and my cousin over what she wanted luckily we resolved that while conflictbut I guess it bubbled in the background a lilbit I did tell my mum just now accthat the only way that they'll deal with it is if they take some time and then talk it through when they are feeling less exhausted Hmmbecause obviously they're pissing each other off a lotBut maybe They'll be more honest when they are a bit annoyed..?IdknoI disagreeNot as inAbout how they feelthey'll exaggerate it when they are annoyedBut like whats bothering them..?they'll say something stupidand thenmum will go her parents house in Birmingham for a few days or sthor dad will go crash at his sister's for a bitor a hotel or sthSo this has happened before..?that's what's happened once or twice in my life.but likeI've never seen it this bador maybeit's been this bad bdforeThats probably cuz ur olderBut I was too young to seeYhMy parents told me a similar thing recently actuallyAnyway im sure yk ur parents better than I doAnd if u think they need time..encourage them to do that maybe..?But I dont think there is any particular contempt or disliking in this contextJust lack of communication maybe..?So I think everything will be okOr at least my perspective is sure..I hope soIf that means anthinhAnything..Hmmso yeahThat's where I'm atA little life updateYk its interesting how u went to go hug ur dad..Cuz my dad and I hv the kind of relationshiphe said 'i love you'but didn't want the hugAwwWellthat fine thenI should've said it backBut I didn't in the momentwhich is bad of meIts okJust say it tmrYeah..Say u lost ur voiceOr u didnt wanna cryI'll see what he's like tmrBut u probably wont need tomum is going to the officeCoolso they'll get some spsce tmr which may do some goodbut her car is brokenso he"ll have to drop herWhat actually happened To her car..?so idk what's gonna happen.it's not even that badher car just feels "jittery" apparently it's 200 days late of a serviceDid u consult a mechanic..?OhWait what does that meanwellevery few years you're supposed to get a car checked by a mechanic for faults etcand basically that car was due to be checked(the cars on board computer reminds you when)Is that MOTbut we never got around to checking itnoOr am I mixing them upWhats that thenMOT is a test that the government operate to check the car is operating okaya service may involve actually fixing and maintaining things like changing oil RighttSo why dont u just call a mechanic..?because likedad usually does itand againssuper busy guyJust call a mechanicand causeProblem solved���OhWell clearly ��� anywayCuz its vrockenBrokenum wellIt's drivablewe just don't wanna risk it breaking down

practice???heheLike they kept saying random ass words like 'overexerting' and other stuffLike I was like wtfso they were just salty?Not evenLike even at the startThey were so mean to the other friendOh apparently I hv to stop 'OAing'OAing?Exactly."over arming'what's that mean?Hitting it overarmAs opposed to underarmOHofcheheI was tempted to shove that shuttlecock down their throat and out the other endJk ofcSory laptop diedU still there?did your laptop die?YesSorryheheIm heresoSowhat were u saying?Basically they were being very full of themselves and like going separately to go play by themselvesTo put the cherry on topWhen Alisha walked in they invited her to play with them...cuz she was good enough (she's an amazing tennis player btw)And squashRight...So ofc she met their standardsThen I realised why they wanted me to come...They wanted me to keep the third friend busy..The fact that I hadn't even been going this whole time..And by whole time I mean academic yearAnd then I told the third friend after a whileThat we can go and ill make them dinnerCuz they looked visibly upsetThen on the way backThey told me how mean the other two can be esp when im not there-*three actually :(that's not niceLITERALLYLike if they were actually good, reputable playersId even start to understand their behaviourBut even stillIf its rlly that botheringit's not nice, no

gives a shitWell A lot of ppl do keep it to themselvesBUTits rare for ppl to be forwardly homophobicYeah I mean that's common here :(Anywayswanna hear about what happened today with Hackathon?Mhmsotwo days agoI sent an email to Mr Toddhe's director of supercurriculumAsking him to put it on the school calendar so he said, that's fine, as long as Dr Harrison (deputy head teacher) approves itsoI email Dr HarrisonI explain what it is and how it worjsworks*and who it involves etcSohe replied todayyk what he said?WhatI dont approveWell closeholdon lemme grab the email for uDear Dylan,     Thank you for getting in touch about this.     It sounds like an interesting initiative.     I don�t think we can call it a hackathon � that perhaps doesn�t quite set the right tone.  Let�s come up with another name.  Can you come back with a suitable alternative?     We need to think very carefully about expansion to schools beyond the Harrow family.  That would need further discussion.  My advice would be to stick to the Harrow family of schools.      I�d be happy to meet with you and CMC to discuss further if necessary. LMAOsois he one of those ppl who think a hackathon involved hacking???How do I unsend emails to 20+ schoolswhich have already been readLiterally tell him its too lateMe and Vincent will meet with him next weekprobablyso uhDr Crowe bit backWhen I asked croweHe said that Harrison's email was full of crapsoIt is...You sure he knows exactly what it is..?so Crowe wrote an email vackasking to reconsiderand to emphasise that LITERALLY EVERYONE CALLS IT A HACKATHONbut thenPfftCrowe forgot to tell him we had already sent invites outUh ohand Crowe signed off the ema "Best Wishes, Dylan" which means the guy must've been shattered ...heheso yh So that happened When is ur detentionwhy would I get one?n?!*For sending that email wdymWell sending 'Well usuallyIf u try to 'bite back' hereIts disrespectful Nononowait do I understand what happened Crowe wrote an emailYhand sent itbut accidentally He signed it offsigned it in my nameyehYhBut I dont imagineok coolCrowe would've written the Kindest email..dya wanna see it?It was pretty well worded t hrbhSuretbh*but also quite longOhhttps://ibb.co/gDWMJFXhere woah that screenshot glitched!!?ignore thatDear Dr Harrison,     Thank you for your thoughtful response and for considering the initiative. I appreciate your concerns about the event's naming and its implications. However, I would like to politely and respectfully present a case for retaining the name "hackathon."     The term "hackathon" has become universally recognized and widely accepted in all educational and professional circles. Leading institutions including every top 20 UK University, all 8 Ivy League Colleges, and countless top graduate recruitment schemes use this term - major companies around the world regularly host events under this name to boost engagement. It signifies a collaborative, creative, and intensive problem-solving session, often with a focus on technology and innovation. This positive connotation is well-established and resonates with a broad audience, especially among our target demographic of tech-savvy and forward-thinking students.     Moreover, renaming the event might inadvertently reduce its appeal and recognition. The term "hackathon" carries with it a sense of excitement and challenge, aspects we aim to foster in our event. It aligns perfectly with our goals of encouraging creative thinking, teamwork, and practical application of skills in a competitive yet collaborative environment.     I would encourage Dylan and Vincent to discuss with you further and explore all aspects of the event, including its naming and scope. Your guidance and insights will be invaluable in ensuring the success and appropriateness of the event.     Thank you again for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to another fantastic international event, the only one of its kind which includes every other member of the Harrow family.     Best wishes,     DylanthereIts okIm fluent in glitchcrowes response sounds so chagptishhYh jt does..But its more sincere than I thought it'd beI wouldn't be surprised if he gave chatgpt a rude version and told it to make it longer and friendlierLMAOomg i should do that-lmaoVincent just messaged mehe's gonna chat with Harrison tmrhe has maths with himhmm what else happened today uhhsaltburn was a

came back from med center yesterdayyou got me so curious nowwwwwhat TEA have u GOT?!?can u atleast give me a clue?!ok fine basicallyyk i was talking bout badmintonand i mentioned a couple amongst my friendsbasically they kinda broke upmhm?but nobody i would know right?bc one was putting more effort and emotion in than the otherat least from what i knowrightnobody would knowbuti doand likei dont know muchbut knowing the alleged red flag's last relationship experiencei kinda maybe saw it comingnobody would know?i was answering ur qyes soanyway like so far i think em and i know bc the sad one is being sadand the other one hasnt been acting sadanyway yesterdayi was like communicateso they didand apparently they were both upsetand they both said they loved each otherbut then at break i was likewhen they told me thatit might be truebut if u love someoneu should be willing to accept their flawsand help them work on themselvesinstead of being embarassed of their shortcomingsand being annoyed by themalso likeactions speak louder than words??like if they aren't making the effort to communicate or bring up important stuff or whateverand the person who told me about it is the only one doing itfrom what i can seelike surely its a bit toxic?? idk-idkbut like basicallythey wanna get back togetherand im likei dont think thats a good idea imo-but againthats based off what one person has told mebut like the other person did talk about their feelings being different before they broke up so...?also pilot friend keeps asking about u like ykand im just likeplssss stooop]its not like how's dylanand then conversation ends.its like she's trying to probe stuff out of me and then there was a point where i was gonna tell her about it-but now its getting kind of annoying but i dont know what to do...other than just try change topicright..i meanwhat kinda stuff is she asking?the same thing she asks every time she sees me'have you broken up yet'btw i'm kinda talking to a guy about a-level choices at same time so...oh-i mean u can say yes to her igif you trust herits not a problemthats not it tho-bc she's gonna take it the wrong wayand then she'll tell everyonebut its also just the factthat i try to give her the most accurate answer i can each timerthen she's like i dont believe u???or sth randomand then im just like ok....idk what u want me to say-then she starts probingand as u already knowit wasnt a very happy time for either of us and its not the easiest of memoeries to revisitso everytime..i literally look visibly uncomfortable and literally sometimes even ask to change topic-but like she's so persistent its like ughhhhlike literally at lunch todayshe asked if i was gonna meet uthen i said nobut then i smiled bc the thought of it made me smile-but then she was like 'ur hiding sth'and i was like what?!!ok i feel like ive gone on a bit of a tangentin conclusioni feel like my friends should stop dating each other cuz it never ends well-but then i also feel like i cant be too in favour of one ideaesp if i havent actually spoken to the other person about this topic.yhU there?uhyhyhi'm a little confusedbut i think i get the rough a ideaYh sry went on a bit of the tangentSoThoughts?uhhwhy dont u just ask her to stop asking Hmmm ok..Im just worried she'll ask even more tho-Or maybe even assumeBut ig that isnt as badBut I meant thoughts on the other sitchi dont quite understand other sitcould u summarise it?.Two friends dating from badmintonDynamic not goodOH YESi remember now!so... what happened ?Ok goodREADi cant scroll up.it gliched out so i refreshedOhBad dynamicmhmMean one being critical, embarrassed and said 'feelungs r different'right..Sad one gets very sad and ask if they should break upMean one says yhI told them to communicate so they broke up?YhButThey spoke yesterdayAnd apparently they both still love each otherAt break todayI said to sad oneActions speak louder than wordsIeThey can say thar but I dint see them showing that or making effort from what u hv told mei seeso Sad one is realllyyyy in loveSo they wanna get back tgtand mean one?But imo I dont think its a good ideaMean one yes I think?okay sofirstlywhatever u tell themmatters as an opinionbut in the endits their choiceWell yh duhSecondly?i thinkthey should probably take a breaksee how it goes for a weekmaybe a monthlet things cool downI think thats
